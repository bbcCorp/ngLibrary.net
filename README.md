# ngLibrary.net

Hello and welcome to ngLibrary.net. This is a reference library using two of my favourite technologues - AngularJS and Asp.net Core 2.0. I will attempt to make this reference application as full featured as possible so that various aspects of the application architecture and design as well as use of components can be demonstrated.

## Project structure

src 
    + client : (contains angular client application code)
        - src : (angular application source)
    + server : (contains dontnetcore projects)
        - ngLibrary.Core
        - ngLibrary.Data
        - ngLibrary.Model
        - ngLibary.Test
        - ngLibrary.Web (this is the Aspnet Core 2 Web API application)

We will also sprinkle some Docker magic to tie up the client and server applications.
